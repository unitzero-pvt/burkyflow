//
// To add a new landing page:
//   1. Add the city to `cities` if it is new.
//   2. Add the niche to `niches` if it is new.
//   3. (Optional) Add a `combos` entry keyed `${niche}/${city}` to override
//      copy. If you skip it, the template renders from niche + city defaults.
//
// Copy is seeded from the BurkyFlow cold-email angles (A/B/C/D) so the voice
// matches outbound. Keep it factual: we serve these metros REMOTELY. No
// physical-presence claims. Schema uses Service.areaServed, not LocalBusiness.
